# Project Name

<!-- ONE LINE: what this project is, primary language/framework, deployment target -->

## Rules

### Always
- Read README.md and relevant docs before modifying unfamiliar code
- Run Verify commands before declaring work done
- Update docs and skills alongside code changes
- Write plans to `.claude/workspace/` in the project root for non-trivial changes

### Anti-patterns
- Don't wrap things the underlying library already expresses clearly
- Don't speculate about fixes — investigate first, then propose
- Don't hardcode derived counts in comments — they drift silently

### Ask first
- Changing public API signatures or database schemas
- Deleting files or removing features

### Never
- Commit or push unless explicitly asked or instructed by a command
- Add dependencies without stating the reason
- Put secrets or credentials in tracked files

## Corrections

<!-- Version mismatches are the most common — fill these in early.
"We use Pydantic v2 field_validator, not v1 validator."
"Next.js 15 uses async cookies() — not the sync API from v14." -->

## Skills

Project conventions live in `.claude/skills/`. Check the relevant skill when working in an unfamiliar area:

- **api-error-patterns** — error response format, status codes
- **claude-config** — agents vs skills vs commands
- **docs-patterns** — writing style, structure, brevity
- **frontend-patterns** — design tokens, mobile-first, component isolation
- **github-conventions** — branches, commits, issue/PR templates
- **logging-patterns** — log levels, formatting, structured output
- **testing-patterns** — integration tests, fixture composition, canary markers
- **recursive-development** — decomposing work into waves of parallel nested subagents with TDD, scope-based ownership, and review-fix cycles

## Verify

<!-- REQUIRED — replace with your build/test/lint commands:
make test
npm run build && npm test
cargo check && cargo test
pytest -x
-->
